# DSCL-EXP-01
Short Description: This C program initializes a variable var with an integer value 19, a variable var1 with a floating-point value 3.14, and a variable char1 with a character value 'H'. Then the program prints the value of var as an integer, the value of var1 as a float, and the value of char1 as a character.

Algorithm:

Initialize an integer variable var with the value 19. Initialize a floating-point variable var1 with the value 3.14. Initialize a character variable char1 with the value 'H'. Print the value of var using the %d format specifier. Print the value of var1 using the %f format specifier. Print the value of char1 using the %c format specifier. Exit the program.

Output: When this program is executed, it will print the values of var, var1, and char1 on separate lines. The output will be as follows:

19 3.140000 H
